TREE RANDOMIZER

Thank you for downloading Tree Randomizer!

This editor plugin allows you to generate multiple different trees from one tree.

Basically this plugin duplicates the tree and randomizes its seed. 
But it also references the materials of the original/template tree to minimize disk space usage.

USAGE:
To open the editor window navigate to Tools -> Tree Randomizer

Now drag a tree from the project window into the 'Tree Template' slot. The tree count specifies how many trees will be generated.
Finally press 'Generate Trees'.
The trees will be generated to a sub-folder named 'Generated'.

If the trees appear to have no texture, try these things:
- reimport terrain (in project explorer, rightclick and then press "Reimport")
- reimport trees 
- change seed of textureless trees again
